QUESTION 2:  What states are models of high-quality care?

ANSWER:
The best_states table was similar to the initial table from Q1 (hospital
rating).  However, the scores were grouped by state rather than by hospital,
and again the average and total sum scores are presented.  

One consideration was in adding the procedures scores, as was done for Q1.
However, when procedure scoring was added, the results were changed with a
higher ranking of rural states.  These states also had a much lower number of
procedures done, which could greatly increase or decrease their ranking
overall, depending on how few procedures they did and their scores.  Unlike
Q1, I chose not to filter out states which had lower number of procedures
because that would be a biased representation of quality of care if those
states were completely removed.  Therefore, I elected not to include the
procedure scores, and to only focus on the timely effective care and the
overall national ratings.  The output shows the states in descending order of
average scoring and displays total scores.
