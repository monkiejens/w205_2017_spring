Question1:  What hospitals are models of high-quality care?  That is, which
hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?

Answer:
The question defines “high-quality care” as having consistently high
scores for different procedures.  However, it should be noted that the
criteria included in the hospitals.csv file (overall rating, comparison with
national mortality/safety/readmission etc) should also be included in the
definition because it gives a more complete picture of the quality of care a
hospital delivers.

Therefore, I took the rating and comparison scores in from the my_hospital
table and created hospital_rating table.  The hospital_rating table joined
with hospital_effectivenss to include the scoring on the hospitals’ timely
care (or lack thereof!).  This table also calculated the mean of all
comparison scores (mortality, safety, patient, timeliness) and aggregate sum
of all scores.  Finally, the table filtered out any hospitals with an overall
score of 1 since they are lower quality.

In order to incorporate the scoring for procedure quality, the information
from procedures_readmission was joined with procedures_readmission on
hospital_name and provider_id to create the final table best_hospitals.  This
table added the procedure scores to the aggregate sum from hospital_rating
table and also calculated the average score and standard deviation, as well as
the total score.  The output shows the top 10 highest quality hospitals with
their provider_id, hospital_name, state (I added this in because I was
curious), the average score, standard deviation, and total scores.
