QUESTION 3:  Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

ANSWER:
The table procedure_variability was created from procedures_readmission by
incorporating the procedure score and grouping it by the procedure names and
ids.  By considering each procedure to be its own population, I used
STDDEV_POP on the procedure scores to demonstrate variability.  However, it
should be noted that in the description of the Readmissions and Deaths (which
was used for the procedure scores) in the Medicare dictionary, it was
mentioned that there were smaller hospitals which performed fewer cases.
Therefore number of cases is too small to reliably compare.  I thought those
hospitals with fewer procedures could skew the average scoring, so also
filtered out any hospital that had less than 100 of that type of procedure.

The output is interesting because it is relatively consistent with a medical
perspective.  The highest variability is with pneumonia and heart failure.
Pneumonia is an umbrella term with multiple etiologies and can manifest with a
variety of complications.  Heart failure also can develop with various degrees
of severity.  However, it is surprising that the death rate for stroke
patients second on the list for variability rather than the readmission rate.
It would be interesting to correlate the hospital quality with the death rate
of stroke patients - perhaps smaller hospitals have less access to
neurosurgery or neurologists specializing in stroke that would be required to
treat and follow these patients effectively.
